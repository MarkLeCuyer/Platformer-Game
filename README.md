***Notes***: 

* The environment was set up using GMS version 2022.9.1.51.
* I have taken the assets from this starter kit and the lesson in the tutorial to make a platformer game of my own. 
* I take no credit for the assets or the concepts.
* I have used my own original sprite with an idle, walk, and jump animation.
* I used the tiles from the tutorial to build by own mini world of platforms to jump on and adventure.
* Game takes about 30 seconds to get from start to end.
